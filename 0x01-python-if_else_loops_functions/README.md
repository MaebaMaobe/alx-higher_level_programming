Tasks 
0.  program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

1. program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed
  The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
the number, followed by
the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

2. program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

3. program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.all the letters except q and e
4. program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal. 

5. program that prints numbers from 0 to 99

6. program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits

7. function that checks for lowercase character.

8. function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line

9. function that prints the last digit of a number

10. function that adds two integers and returns the result

11. function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

12. function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
   For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz

13. function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list

ADVANCED TASKS

14. program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

15. function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

16. Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode
